## Goal 

What we want here, is to create a generic filtering process for some cities and show them to the map. The data is a json that contains the keys of the cities and values dictionaries of climate hazards (type, magnitude and probaility) that the city is suffering from. You have to edit the reusable component, called SelectMultiple that will have as an argument the type of filter (climate hazard type, magnitude and probaility), and will return the filtered cities that include one or more filter types chosen by user. 
There are some hints in the code, that are not the mandatory way of solving this.
